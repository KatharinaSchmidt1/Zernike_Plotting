# Zernike_Plotting
MatLab Code to plot images (.eps) of Zernike polynomials

## Source of functions
The functions calcShape and calcPoly derive from:

      @inbook{inbook,author={Scott W. Teare}, 
      title        = {Optics using MatLab},
      chapter      = 10,
      pages        = {139-153},
      publisher    = {SPIE Press},
      year         = 2017,

    }
    
## How to use
1. Download all files into the same folder
2. Start *main.mlx* and set the current folder to working directory or add it to PATH
3. Insert resolution of the derived images (Pixel)
4. Place a checkmark in the boxes of the Zernikes you want to plot
5. The plots appear in the live editor and in the current folder
